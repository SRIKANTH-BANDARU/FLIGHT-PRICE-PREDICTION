# FLIGHT-PRICE-PREDICTION
We have to analyzing the flight fare prediction of data using a machine learning concept and using essential exploratory data analysis techniques then after we will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.

The main objectives of this project are:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that significantly influence the flight price prediction.

Model Training: Utilizing the XGBRegressor algorithm to train a predictive model on the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Creating a user-friendly interface or API where users can input their information, and the model can predict the likelihood of flight price prediction.

Through this project, I aim to provide insights into the factors influencing flight price prediction and develop a reliable predictive model that can provide more reliable estimations, aiding airlines and travelers alike in making informed decisions regarding ticket pricing and itinerary planning. . The code and documentation will be made available on GitHub for anyone interested in replicating the project or exploring further.
